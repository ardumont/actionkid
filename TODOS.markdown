- adding music?
- builtin movieclips with MovieClip instances to make it easier to get started?

- this package will let you load images of all types, not just bitmaps:
    http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss-juicy

- this guy had the same idea I did: https://github.com/mchakravarty/gloss-game
- add support for tilemaps

- templatehaskell for attrs boilerplate?
  - especially if an MC has multiple types like `data Tile = Player | Enemy`, you can't just use the default lens.
- moveX/moveY signals as signal attrs?

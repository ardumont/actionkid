- add attrs automatically using templatehaskell?
- change the coordinate system to start with lower-left as (0,0)...that is a much saner default for 2d tilebased games IMO - DONE
- can I get the bounding box for a picture (size and position)? If so, I could do collision detection, which would be awesome.
